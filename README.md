## UPCOMING DEPRECATION NOTICE!

Since Svelte 5 and its runes have made stores more and more obsolete, it's time to start removing them 
from this library. For many things, there's no point in specifically using a store
when a `$state()` or `$derived()` would work better. 

As such, **starting soon, I will be phasing out various legos in `stores`**, getting rid of 
or rewriting as many as possible.

Yes, this is a breaking change.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

```bash
npm i @sveltelegos-blue/svelte-legos
```

## A note about version numbers

Semantic Versioning is a bit silly. 

I very likely will not be bumping this to a major version for _**quite**_ a while. 
Given that, assume that minor versions (0.**x**.y) **can** include entirely breaking changes.
They very likely won't, but, don't get comfortable. 

Patch versions (0.x.**y**) will never break things. In fact, they'll usually fix things. 

## Local setup

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Current Todos/Projects

- [ ] Actual dark mode design, not just haphazard application of colours where they look good.
- [ ] Styles consolidation (ie. actual themes)

Contributions to these lofty goals are welcome.
